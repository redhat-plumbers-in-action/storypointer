## Description

Simple CLI tool that provides an interactive interface to quickly set priority, severity and story points for your JIRA issues. No need to open the JIRA web interface.

StoryPointer uses base JQL query to fetch issues that are not closed and have no story points or priority set - `Project = RHEL AND (type in (Story, Task) AND ("Story Points" is EMPTY OR priority is EMPTY) OR type not in (Story, Task) AND ("Story Points" is EMPTY OR priority is EMPTY OR Severity is EMPTY)) AND status != Closed`. The query can be customized using the CLI command options or by setting ENV variables.

## Usage

Make sure to store your JIRA Personal Access Token (PAT) in the `~/.config/storypointer/.env` or `~/.env.storypointer` file:

```bash
# ~/.config/storypointer/.env
JIRA_API_TOKEN="exaple-token"
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also set default values for the `assignee`, `developer`, `component` and more in the `~/.config/storypointer/.env` or `~/.env.storypointer` file:
>
> ```bash
> # ~/.config/storypointer/.env
> ASSIGNEE="your-jira-username"
> DEVELOPER="your-jira-username"
> TEAM="your-jira-team"
> COMPONENT="your-component"
> JQL="your-jql-query"
> ```

### Using Node.js

```bash
# run it using npx
npx storypointer

# or install it globally using npm
npm install -g storypointer
storypointer
```

### Using RHEL Developer Toolbox

StoryPointer is available as a module in [RHEL Developer Toolbox](https://gitlab.com/redhat/rhel/tools/rhel-developer-toolbox). StoryPointer module documentation is available [here](https://gitlab.com/redhat/rhel/tools/rhel-developer-toolbox/-/blob/main/doc/source/modules/storypointer.rst).

## How to use

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This tool is intended to be used by Red Hat employees on the Red Hat JIRA instance. It may be adapted to work with other JIRA instances in the future.

  -c, --component [component]  Issue component, use `!` to exclude component
  -a, --assignee [assignee]    Issue assignee, use `!` to exclude assignee (default: "<user-login>@redhat.com")
  -d, --developer [developer]  Issue developer, use `!` to exclude developer
